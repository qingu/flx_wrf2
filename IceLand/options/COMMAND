1. Simulation direction, 1 for forward, -1 for backward in time 
	(consult Seibert and Frank, 2004 for backward runs)

2. Beginning date and time of simulation. Must be given in format
   YYYYMMDD HHMISS, where YYYY is YEAR, MM is MONTH, DD is DAY, HH is HOUR,
   MI is MINUTE and SS is SECOND. Current version utilizes UTC.

3. Ending date and time of simulation. Same format as 3.

4. Average concentrations are calculated every SSSSS seconds.

5. The average concentrations are time averages of SSSSS seconds
   duration. If SSSSS is 0, instantaneous concentrations are outputted.

6. The concentrations are sampled every SSSSS seconds to calculate the time
   average concentration. This period must be shorter than the averaging time.

7. Time constant for particle splitting. Particles are split into two
   after SSSSS seconds, 2xSSSSS seconds, 4xSSSSS seconds, and so on.

8. All processes are synchronized with this time interval (lsynctime).
   Therefore, all other time constants must be multiples of this value.
   Output interval and time average of output must be at least twice lsynctime.

9. CTL must be >1 for time steps shorter than the  Lagrangian time scale
   If CTL<0, a purely random walk simulation is done

10.IFINE=Reduction factor for time step used for vertical wind

11.IOUT determines how the output shall be made: concentration
   (ng/m3, Bq/m3), mixing ratio (pptv), or both, or plume trajectory mode,
   or concentration + plume trajectory mode.
   In plume trajectory mode, output is in the form of average trajectories.

12.IPOUT determines whether particle positions are outputted (in addition
   to the gridded concentrations or mixing ratios) or not.
   0=no output, 1 output every output interval, 2 only at end of the
   simulation

13.Switch on/off subgridscale terrain parameterization (increase of
   mixing heights due to subgridscale orographic variations)

14.Switch on/off the convection parameterization

15.Switch on/off the calculation of age spectra: if yes, the file AGECLASSES
   must be available

16. If IPIN=1, a file "partposit_end" from a previous run must be available in
    the output directory. Particle positions are read in and previous simulation
    is continued. If IPIN=0, no particles from a previous run are used

17. If IFLUX is set to 1, fluxes of each species through each of the output
    boxes are calculated. Six fluxes, corresponding to northward, southward,
    eastward, westward, upward and downward are calculated for each grid cell of
    the output grid. The control surfaces are placed in the middle of each
    output grid cell. If IFLUX is set to 0, no fluxes are determined.

18. If MDOMAINFILL is set to 1, the first box specified in file RELEASES is used
    as the domain where domain-filling trajectory calculations are to be done.
    Particles are initialized uniformly distributed (according to the air mass
    distribution) in that domain at the beginning of the simulation, and are
    created at the boundaries throughout the simulation period.

19. IND_SOURCE switches between different units for concentrations at the source
    NOTE that in backward simulations the release of computational particles 
    takes place at the "receptor" and the sampling of particles at the "source".
          1=mass units (for bwd-runs = concentration)
          2=mass mixing ratio units 
20. IND_RECEPTOR switches between different units for concentrations at the receptor
          1=mass units (concentrations)
          2=mass mixing ratio units 

21. MQUASILAG indicates whether particles shall be numbered consecutively (1) or
    with their release location number (0). The first option allows tracking of
    individual particles using the partposit output files

22. NESTED_OUTPUT decides whether model output shall be made also for a nested
    output field (normally with higher resolution)

23. TURB_OUTPUT determines how turbulence velocity components are calculated.
    0=no turbulence
    1=diagnosed from surface fluxes, ..., as is done in FLEXPART_ECMWF
    2=calculated from TKE

24. ADD_SFC_LAYER
    1=add an extra vertical level near the surface using 10 m winds and
        2 m temp. and humidity.
    0=do not add extra level
