To install RefactorF4ACC:

- Put the script refactorF4ACC.pl in your path
- Put the RefactorF4ACC folder somewhere where Perl will find it (e.g. /usr/local/share/perl5) or put it anywhere and append the path to PERL5LIB in your
.bashrc or similar.

For example, I have /home/wim/bin in my PATH, so I put refactorF4ACC.pl there; and I have PERL5LIB="/home/wim/perl5/lib/perl5" so I put the RefactorF4ACC folder
there.
