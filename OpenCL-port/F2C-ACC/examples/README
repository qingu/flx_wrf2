This directory provides a Makefile that can be modified to build CUDA or C
source using the F2C-ACC compiler.  To use this makefile, you may need to 
modify the paths for $GPU_HOME, $CUDA and $CUDALIBS.

You will also need to download and install the m4 support library from the 
GNU website: http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/.

The CUDA compiler and support libraries are available from the NVIDIA web site.

To generate CUDA, enter:
  F2C-ACC --Generate=CUDA --Free loop.cu

To generate C enter:
  F2C-ACC --Generate=C --Free loop.o
